simplicial complexes paper:

- find examples from other places in math that we can reproduce in macaulay2
- showcase functionality, specifically on simplicial maps which are new
- do some relative homology, try to find some interesting topological results
- browse through some papers in jsag journal to get ideas for structure
- showcase database functionality
- basic fact that we represent complexes by stanley-reisner ideals
- showcase lybenziunk complexes and general homogenization feature
- database could be used to give examples of relative homology

next week should brainstorm more ideas for this


----------------
rough section planning

- Section 2 (combinatorics)
- f-vectors, h-vectors, cohen-macaulay + shellability are the themes for this section.
- Should give some of the motivation in identifying Cohen-Macaulay rings
- Prop 3.1 ch 3 of Stanley gives a condition for checking CM
- Show examples of shellable + non-shellable
- Rudin, Ziegler ball are not CM, give good examples of non-shellable complexes
- Use Reisner's criterion (corollary 5.3.9) in Bruns-Herzog for an example + non-example
- Another way to check CM is to look at the minimal free resolution to compute projective
  dimension and compare with dimension (may be worth mentoning)
- Lemma 5.1.8 relates h and f-vectors
- Use Thm 5.1.5 in Bruns-Herzog on an example to illustrate connection with h-vector
- Ex 1.2 in Stanley for h-vector relating to poincare series of P1 x P1

- Section 3 (resolutions)
- Give examples of all(?) of our complex constructions
- Scarf resolution
- Nearly scarf ideals: pick something in database, construct the nearly scarf ideal,
  then show that scarf complex is the same
- If you have a resolution supported on a complex, one way to determine if its a resolution
  is to do all induced subcomplexes of the lcm sublattice of the ring
- Reuse ex 1.2 above to compute minimal free resolution of irrelevant ideal of P1 x P1
- Taylor resolution that's not minimal
- References: Miller-Sturmfels, Peeva, ...

- Section 4 (toplogy)
- Simplicial maps, relative homology, database of small 2/3-manifolds
- Maybe take a classical map (Hopf fibration), then approximate by simplicial complexes
  and illustrate the example
- To this end, find classical examples in toplogy. e.g. in Hatcher/Munkres
- References: Munkres, Hatcher, ...
