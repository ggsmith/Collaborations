simplicial complexes paper:

- find examples from other places in math that we can reproduce in macaulay2
- showcase functionality, specifically on simplicial maps which are new
- do some relative homology, try to find some interesting topological results
- browse through some papers in jsag journal to get ideas for structure
- showcase database functionality
- basic fact that we represent complexes by stanley-reisner ideals
- showcase lybenziunk complexes and general homogenization feature
- database could be used to give examples of relative homology

next week should brainstorm more ideas for this
